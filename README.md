### analytics

#### get-codec

```txt
$ pypxml get-codec --help
Usage: pypxml get-codec [OPTIONS] FILES...

  This tool analyzes the text content of PageXML files and extracts the set of
  characters used.

  It can optionally normalize unicode, remove whitespace, and output character
  frequencies. Results are printed to the console or saved as a CSV file.

  FILES: List of PageXML file paths to process. Accepts individual files, glob
  wildcards, or directories.

Options:
  -o, --output FILE               Path to a CSV file to save the results. If
                                  omitted, results are printed to stdout. If a
                                  directory is given, the file 'codec.csv'
                                  will be created inside it.
  -l, --level [TextRegion|TextLine|Word|Glyph]
                                  PageXML level from which to extract text.
                                  [default: TextLine]
  -i, --index INTEGER             Only consider TextEquiv elements with the
                                  specified index.
  -w, --remove-whitespace         Remove all whitespace characters before
                                  analyzing text.
  -f, --frequencies               Also output character frequencies.
  -n, --normalize [NFC|NFD|NFKC|NFKD]
                                  Normalize unicode before analyzing text.
```

#### get-regions

  Optionally includes subtypes, outputs frequencies, and group by file,
  directory, or globally.

  FILES: List of PageXML file paths to process. Accepts individual files, glob
  wildcards, or directories.

                                  saved. If a directory is given, the file
                                  'regions.csv' will be created inside it. If
                                  omitted, results are printed to stdout.
  -l, --level [total|directory|file]
                                  Set the aggregation level for the output.
                                  'total' combines all files, 'directory'
                                  aggregates by parent directory, and 'file'
                                  lists results per individual file.
                                  [default: total]
  -f, --frequencies               Also output the frequency (count) of each

                                  'customs.csv' will be created inside it. If
                                  omitted, results are printed to stdout.

                               each PageXML file, ignoring the page separator.
                               If a file is specified, the text from all files
                               is concatenated into that file. If omitted, the
                               text is printed to stdout.
  -i, --index INTEGER          Use only the text from TextEquiv elements at
                               the given index.
  -r, --region-separator TEXT  Separator string inserted between regions. Use
                               "" for an empty line, "\n" for two empty lines,
                               ...

                                  elements if not set.
  -l, --level [TextRegion|TextLine|Word|Glyph]
                                  PageXML element level to process.  [default:
                                  TextLine]
  --plaintext / --unicode         Select the text element to use.Choose from
                                  PlainText (without formatting) or Unicode

                                  rule is a pair of strings: '--rule SOURCE
                                  TARGET'. Multiple rules can be specified by

```

#### regularize-regions

```txt
$ pypxml regularize-regions --help
Usage: pypxml regularize-regions [OPTIONS] FILES...

  This tool processes PageXML files and updates or removes regions based on
  specified rules.

  Regions are matched by their PageType and optional subtype. Regions matching
  the source specification are either updated to a new type or deleted if
  target is set to 'None'.

  FILES: List of PageXML file paths to process. Accepts individual files, glob
  wildcards, or directories.

Options:
  -o, --output DIRECTORY  Directory to save the modified PageXML files. If
                          omitted, input files will be overwritten.
  -r, --rule TEXT...      Define rules for region regularization. Format:
                          --rule SOURCE TARGET where SOURCE is the original
                          region type (e.g., TextRegion.paragraph,
                          ImageRegion), and TARGET is the new region type. Use
                          an 'None' TARGET to delete the region. Only region
                          PageTypes are allowed. Multiple rules can be
                          specified by repeating this option.  [required]
